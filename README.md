# cricheroes-coding-challenge
This notebook contains a dataset of an international t-20 match played between England Vs Australia in 2005. The notebook uses Pandas to perform manipulation on the csv files using the extensive functions that Python Pandas offer.

# Prerequisites
In order to better view and work, I encourage you to use Jupyter notebook. The Jupyter Notebook application allows you to create and edit documents that display the input and output of a Python or R language script. You will also need to download the Pandas packages. In addition to this, if you are a cricket buff, then you will be knowing most of the terms that are used in cricket. If you are not that much into cricket, you can refer to the data dictionary attached in the file section. Otherwise, you can always use Google.

# Data
The questions require a cricket dataset in order to work. Data is already provided in the Folder data in the form of .csv file(cricket_dataset), but feel free to use any other data you wish by doing the appropraite modifications. Also, some terms that are commonly used in cricket are also attached in the form of data dictionary.
